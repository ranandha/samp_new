    What is a Gas Sensor?
    A gas sensor (also known as gas detectors) is an electronic device that
    detects and identifies different types of gasses.
    What Was My Project?
    My project consisted of a working MQ-135 Gas Sensor that could detect
    gasses such as benzene, sulfur, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and carbon
    monoxide.
    Why Did I Choose To Go Forward With This Project?
    I realized that many people who go outside do not know what gases they
    are inhaling and how harmful they are in the long run. Being exposed to
    harmful gasses at dangerous levels is an issue in places where the air
    quality is low such as India, China, etc. My goal was to create a device
    that could sense these gases immediately and prevent individuals from
    inhaling bad air for a long time.
    Basic Operating System (In-Depth Analysis Is Included Later)
    When the sensor detects a level of gas above 400 PPM, an LED turns on
    indicating the harmful particles in the air.
